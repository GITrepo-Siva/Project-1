Project-1: Predicting Customer Churn Rates for OTT Platforms
Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn rates for Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms using various machine learning models. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies. The project utilizes a dataset of 2,000 instances with features such as viewing habits, engagement metrics, and customer support interactions.Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and includes 2,000 instances with the following characteristics:

Non-Churned Customers: 1,738 instances
Churned Customers: 262 instances
Key features include:

Usage metrics: Total minutes watched, maximum daily minutes, minimum daily minutes.
Customer support interactions: Number of calls made to customer service.
Engagement metrics: Videos watched, multi-screen usage.
Models Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Networks
Results

The best-performing models were Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, which achieved an accuracy of 91%. Key performance metrics include:

Precision: 63% (Random Forest), 61% (Gradient Boosting)
Recall: 55% (Random Forest), 53% (Gradient Boosting)
F1 Score: 59% (Random Forest), 57% (Gradient Boosting)
